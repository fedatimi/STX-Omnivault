# STX-OmniVault - Health Equipment Lifecycle & Validation Tracker

A Clarity smart contract for **transparent tracking of health equipment** through its lifecycle stages and regulatory validation processes. Designed to support robust traceability, authority-based validation, and auditability in decentralized healthcare or medtech supply chains.

---

## üß© Overview

This smart contract allows stakeholders to:

* Register and track health equipment through defined lifecycle **phases**
* Record and verify **validations** by approved regulatory authorities
* Retrieve a **timeline** of status changes for compliance and audits
* Add, revoke, and verify validations (e.g., FDA, CE, ISO)
* Maintain a trusted list of **regulatory authorities**

Ideal for use in **healthcare logistics**, **medical device tracking**, or **supply chain transparency**.
